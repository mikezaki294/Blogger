## üñº Image Upload via Vercel Blob

This project uses [Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob) for image uploads.

**Production (on Vercel):**

* Vercel automatically injects a `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` at build time.
* Uploaded images are stored and served from your Vercel project's Blob dashboard.

**Local Development:**

1. Generate a personal token:

```bash
npx vercel blob token
```

2. Add it to your `.env.local`:

```env
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your-generated-token
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

* All blog posts require a **cover image**, a **title**, and at least one **tag**.
* **Anonymous posting** is supported if the user is not logged in.
* JPEG and PNG images under **2MB** are recommended.
* To use **Google Auth**, ensure your OAuth credentials include:
* Github Auth will only work from deployed website URL, not localhosts

  * `http://localhost:3000`
  * `https://blogger-tau-two.vercel.app`
* Blog images are dynamically resized and cropped to maintain consistent layout.
